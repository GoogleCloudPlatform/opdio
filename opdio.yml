  title: OpenMetadataIO
  description: "OpenMetadataIO is a REST-based API enabling permissioned access to\
    \ versioned metadata in a heterogeneous media supply chain. \nThe purpose of OMIO\
    \ is to create a common source of truth for metadata across production, pre-production\
    \ and post-production workflows; \ntoday those workflows consist of disconnected\
    \ ISV solutions reading and writing metadata to their own proprietary datastores,\
    \ often\nrequiring elaborate export/import and validation procedures to ensure\
    \ integrity of metadata from one step to the next.\n\nOpenMetadataIO seeks to\
    \ solve this problem by offering a unified API for accessing metadata across all\
    \ of these applications.\n\nBelow is the draft specification for the OpenMetadataIO\
    \ API."
