  title: OpenProductionDataIO
  description: "OpenProductionDataIO is a REST-based API enabling permissioned access to\
    \ versioned metadata in a heterogeneous media supply chain.\
    \ \n\n\nThe purpose of OPDIO is to define an open industry standard for interacting \
    \ with media metadata.\
    \ \n\nOpenProductionDataIO seeks to ensure metadata consistency and to provide a\
    \ standard method for integrating software throughout the pre-production and production\
    \ process, by offering a unified API for accessing metadata across all\
    \ of these applications.\
    \n\nBelow is the draft specification for the OpenProductionDataIO API."
