## OpenProductionDataIO
The goal of OpenProductionDataIO (OPDIO) is to define an open industry standard for interacting with media metadata. 

## Problem Statement
We need a way to ensure metadata consistency and to provide a standard method for integrating software throughout the pre-production and production process, without relying on the export/import functions of individual applications. 

## Introducing OpenProductionDataIO
Standardized data access throughout the media workflow
* A REST-based API for performing CRUDL (create, read, update, delete and list) operations against metadata
* OpenAPI-backed API spec allows for rapid mocking and automatic generation of client code
* Builds on MovieLabsâ€™s Ontology for Media Creation (OMC) to deliver a standardized data model throughout the supply chain
